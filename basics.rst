  :from: closed_guard:A
  :to: guard_vs_standing:A
  :opportunity:
    You are postured up and can control his wrist on
    one side, so he can't just grab your heel to sweep you when
    you stand up.
  * hold his chest down with one hand (say right)
    grasping both his lapels.
    Posture up.
  * With your left hand grab sleeve of his arm on your left side
    and hold his hips down with that hand grasping
    his gi over his hip -- protects you against armbar and triangle.
  * shift knee of your right leg in between his butt.
  * shift left knee out against his leg for wider base and
    to start opening his guard by torquing with your whole body,
    using your left elbow to push his leg back out of the way.
  * bring your right knee up (shift from knee to foot)
    to block him from closing the guard
  * as soon as his guard breaks, get your right hand out and close
    to your body, again elbowing his other leg open.
  * Stand with your left leg,
  * stand with your right leg,
    watch out for heel sweep by his free hand on your right.
  * Use your right elbow to help open his guard behind your
    back.
  * as soon as his guard opens, step out of his reach
    and control his legs, or get both arms under his legs and
    roll him up.

:transition:
  :from: closed_guard:D
  :to: mount:A

  :opportunity:
    you control his wrist on your chest, preventing him from posting.

  Get hand on his knee prepared to lift.
  Jerk him forward and off balance, lift his armpit with your fit
  and kick up and across as if to your opp. shoulder.  
  Use your foot to block his leg on same side so he can't post.
  As his weight comes off that side, lift his knee with your hand
  and throw him over.

:transition:
  :title: Scissor sweep to mount
  :from: closed_guard:D
  :to: mount:A
  :opportunity:
    If A rises on one leg (i.e. shifts from knee to foot
    on that side, say your right side) to base for big punches.
  Holding A head-down in standard self-defense closed-guard.

  * open guard and use thrust of right thigh against his body
    to hip-escape onto your left side.  It helps if you rest your
    right foot on his posted leg.
  * holding your right knee against his body, get your right
    foot under his knee as a hook.
  * one combined scissor motion: 

    * thrust your right arm under his armpit,
    * kick your right leg up and across your body;
    * kick your left leg to sweep his other leg in the opposite
      direction left and onto his back.
    * roll with him to mount.


:transition:
  :from: guard_vs_standing:A
  :to: side_control:A

  Quickly get both arms under his legs, pull him to you and up
  off the mat, then fold his legs over him
  and squish him down with all your weight while controlling
  his legs.  Reach your arm (on the side you're attacking on)
  to grasp his lapel as deep as you can, palm down, using
  the bony side of your wrist as a choke.
  Move around to perpendicular to him, keeping
  his leg on your shoulder, and you can use your other hand
  to grab his belt behind his back, to lift him up further
  so you can pass.  To pass, punch your shoulder forward to
  push his leg out of the way, while popping your head back
  to pass his leg.  Get side-control.

:transition:
  :from: guard_vs_standing:A
  :to: side_control:A

  Pull one leg down with outer arm (right, say) on outside of knee and inner
  arm on ankle, as if you're going to pass on that side.
  If he uses his other leg to block you, turn and flop down on
  that leg, with your right shoulder blocking it and your right
  arm hooked inside it to control it.  Block (pin down) his
  other leg with your left leg.  Now switch your base bringing
  your right leg back over your left leg (and over his pinned leg),
  passing his guard.  Now get your weight on his chest for side-control,
  moving your arm out from controlling his leg.

    if A is postured down and posts an arm,
    grab his wrist and lock it with your
    other arm passing over his shoulder and grabbing your
    own wrist.  You can push him towards posting by
    putting all your weight pulling down on his head;
    he'll post a hand (say on your left side).
  * open your guard and drop your right foot and left hand
    to the mat to hip escape slightly away from him to open
    enough space for passing your right arm over his shoulder
    and around his posted arm.  Your body turns slightly away
    from him, towards your left.
  * pass your right arm over his shoulder
    and behind his posted arm and grab your left wrist
    while your left hand grabs his posted wrist.
  * push off both feet to lay down on your back, your 
    body angled to the left away from him, your right
    elbow pressing down into his shoulder blade driving
    his face down into the mat.  This isolates his arm.
  * Now hip escape off right foot and left shoulder to
    move a little further away from him, and wrap
    your legs over his back and hook them to prevent
    him from rolling forward out of the Kimura.
  * turn your entire upper body as a unit to gradually

    and off-balance.  At the same time scissor with your legs
    to roll his body to your left.  Your right foot lifts

      his chest, your whole body to his
  * lift his leg while pushing him back over with torque of

    When he shoots for takedown, you can
    block him with both hands on his
    shoulders.
  * push his head to one side (your left, say)
    and wrap your left arm over & under
    his throat for guillotine: hold your left hand
    like a knife with palm facing your chest, and

    so your wrist's hard bony edge is cutting into his
    throat.  Your right hand clasps your left from beneath.
