:transition:
  :from: side_control:D
  :to: half_guard:D
  :opportunity:
    When A brings leg across for mount, weight will come off
    the trailing leg momentarily, so you can push it (his knee) over your
    leg to half guard.

:transition:
  :from: mount:D
  :to: half_guard:D
  :opportunity:
    If A doesn't have hooks in, presumably you can push his knee over your
    leg to half guard.

:transition:
  :from: half_guard:D
  :to: closed_guard:D

  Hip-escape to get enough space to bring your near-side knee up
  to block his body from re-establishing mount or side-control.
  Then get leg around his back and hip-escape again to get space
  for getting other leg around to closed-guard.

  back while right foot hooks behind his knee to throw him down
  and to your right.

  :type: guillotine
  :from: side_control:A

  :opportunity:
    If D turns to his side, switch your (left) arms from under his
    neck to behind his neck & around for the guillotine, while
    switching your base to lower leg straight out parallel to his
    body and upper leg perpendicular, knee flexed.

  :opportunity:
    you control his wrist on your chest, preventing him from posting.

  Get hand on his knee prepared to lift.
  Jerk him forward and off balance, lift his armpit with your fit
  and kick up and across as if to your opp. shoulder.  
  Use your foot to block his leg on same side so he can't post.
  As his weight comes off that side, lift his knee with your hand
  and throw him over.

:submission:
  :type: armbar
  :from: closed_guard:D

  :opportunity:
    you control his wrist on your chest

  put foot on hip on side you're attacking, push off to pivot
  your body away from that side, then that knee comes
  back around his back to hold him down.  Need to get your other knee
  over his head (push it aside).  press him down, lift hips, armbar.

:submission: 
  :type: triangle
  :from: closed_guard:D

  :opportunity:
    one arm over legs, one arm under

    If A puts one arm under your leg, you can get your knee up
    on his shoulder by his neck, then lock it with the other
    knee, and squish his head down in the triangle.

:submission:
  :type: kimura
  :from: closed_guard:D

  :opportunity:
    if A posts an arm, grab his wrist and lock it with your
    other arm passing over his shoulder and grabbing your
    own wrist.

:submission:
  :type: americana
  :from: mount:A

:transition:
  :from: guard_vs_standing:A
  :to: side_control:A

  Quickly get both arms under his legs, fold his legs over him
  and squish him down with all your weight while controlling
  his legs.  Work your head around his leg to get side-control.

:transition:
  :from: side_control:A
  :to: mount:A

  bring knee across his belly while staying tight and heavy
  on him.  then simply turn your knee and lower leg to his
  other side again without lifting your weight from him.
  Push his legs / knee down out of the way if you need to.
