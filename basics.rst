    your free arm in front of your face and holding that leg
    off.  Say they're attacking your right arm.

    * your right hand grabs your left elbow to defend against the
      armbar.
    * push off against A's legs to turn your body sideways
      towards the arm A's attacking.  Get your right elbow down
      on the mat.
    * Push off that elbow to get your body up, inside A's guard.
      Posture up.

  * control his far-side arm by scooping underhook and
    secure it against your chest.

  * fall back for the armbar

Half Guard
----------

:transition:
  :from: half_guard:D
  :to: closed_guard:A

  Hip-escape to get enough space to bring your near-side knee up
  to block his body from re-establishing mount or side-control.
  Then get leg around his back and hip-escape again to get space
  for getting other leg around to closed-guard.

:transition:
  :from: half_guard:A
  :to: side_control:A
  :opportunity:
    you can control D's far-side shoulder with a hook under
    his armpit.
  Say you have your chest on D's chest with your right leg
  in his half-guard; keep your weight on him.

  * get standard side-control hook: your right arm under
    his far-side armpit, your left arm behind his neck and 
    gripping your right hand.
  * hold his shoulder with your left hand while your right
    hand secures his lapel and pulls it up tight for your
    left hand to grip.  You now have solid control of his
    upper body and shoulder.
  * shift your right arm to control his leg and pry open
    his half-guard enough to pull your leg out.
  * you may have to change your base to get your left leg
    down on his hip to give you strong leverage to
    pull your leg out.
  * pop it over for mount, or side-control.

Face Off
--------

:transition:
  :from: face_off:A
  :to: mount:A
  :opportunity:
    If opponent posts a foot in reach...
  * grab his heel and yank it forwards to make him fall

  * move quickly to side-control or mount, or at a minimum
    get control of his legs for another attack.

:transition:
  :from: face_off:A
  :to: mount:A
  :opportunity:
    Opponent reaches forward and you can control their arm
    and foot on same side to prevent them from posting.
  * grab their sleeve
    (say on your left side) and their lapel with your other hand.
  * block his chest with your right foreleg, knee to your left,
    foot to your right.
  * block his leg on your left side with your foot, as low as
    possible so he can't post.
  * locking his arm to your body, sit back, yanking him forward
    and off-balance.  At the same time scissor with your legs
    to roll his body to your left.  Your right foot lifts
    and shoves his body to the left, while your left leg
    torques his base to the right.
  * roll onto him for the mount.

    you can grab one of his legs, e.g. he steps forward
  * lead with your leg on same side you want to grab his leg.
  * in one quick motion connect to him in several places:

    * wrap hands in handshake low on his leading leg
    * turn your head to the other side and pin your ear to
      his chest, your whole body to his
  * lift his leg while pushing him back over with torque of
    your whole body pasted to his.
  * he will spin as he falls, so side you lifted will turn
    down towards mat.  Roll with him to side-control.

  :type: guillotine
  :from: standing_face_off:A
  :opportunity:
    When he shoots for takedown, you can
    block him with both hands on his
    shoulders.
  * push his head to one side (your left, say)
    and wrap your left arm over & under
    his throat for guillotine: hold your left hand
    like a knife with palm facing your chest, and
    bend your wrist (hand points downward)
    so your wrist's hard bony edge is cutting into his
    throat.  Your right hand clasps your left from beneath. 
  * bring left armpit down to hold his head down,
    and lift with your right arm for the choke.
    Keep your body square to him, don't twist.
  * if you feel he's got momentum enough to take you down,
    drop to the ground but in doing so push off with your
    feet to send your body away from him.  Otherwise he
    could end up in mount on top of you.  Keep your
    headlock.  When you land, wrap your legs round his
    lower back, and gripping him strongly with your
    knees push his lower body toward your feet.
    At the same time pull up on your guillotine for the choke.
