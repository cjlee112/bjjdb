Guard
-----

:transition:
  :from: closed_guard:D
  :to: mount:A

  :opportunity:
    you control his wrist on your chest, preventing him from posting.

  Get hand on his knee prepared to lift.
  Jerk him forward and off balance, lift his armpit with your fit
  and kick up and across as if to your opp. shoulder.  
  Use your foot to block his leg on same side so he can't post.
  As his weight comes off that side, lift his knee with your hand
  and throw him over.

:transition:
  :title: Scissor sweep to mount
  :from: closed_guard:D
  :to: mount:A
  Holding A head-down in standard self-defense closed-guard.

  #. open guard and use thrust of right thigh against his body
     to hip-escape onto your left side.  It helps if you rest your
     right foot on his posted leg.
  #. holding your right knee against his body, get your right
     foot under his knee as a hook.
  #. one combined scissor motion: 

     * thrust your right arm under his armpit,
     * kick your right leg up and across your body;
     * kick your left leg to sweep his other leg in the opposite
       direction left and onto his back.
     * roll with him to mount.

  :opportunity:
    If A rises on one leg (i.e. shifts from knee to foot
    on that side, say your right side) to base for big punches.

:transition:
  :from: guard_vs_standing:A
  :to: side_control:A

  Quickly get both arms under his legs, pull him to you and up
  off the mat, then fold his legs over him
  and squish him down with all your weight while controlling
  his legs.  Reach your arm (on the side you're attacking on)
  to grasp his lapel as deep as you can, palm down, using
  the bony side of your wrist as a choke.
  Move around to perpendicular to him, keeping
  his leg on your shoulder, and you can use your other hand
  to grab his belt behind his back, to lift him up further
  so you can pass.  To pass, punch your shoulder forward to
  push his leg out of the way, while popping your head back
  to pass his leg.  Get side-control.

:transition:
  :from: guard_vs_standing:A
  :to: side_control:A

  Pull one leg down with outer arm (right, say) on outside of knee and inner
  arm on ankle, as if you're going to pass on that side.
  If he uses his other leg to block you, turn and flop down on
  that leg, with your right shoulder blocking it and your right
  arm hooked inside it to control it.  Block (pin down) his
  other leg with your left leg.  Now switch your base bringing
  your right leg back over your left leg (and over his pinned leg),
  passing his guard.  Now get your weight on his chest for side-control,
  moving your arm out from controlling his leg.

  :opportunity:
    you control his wrist on your chest

  put foot on hip on side you're attacking, push off to pivot
  your body away from that side, then that knee comes
  back around his back to hold him down.  Need to get your other knee
  over his head (push it aside).  press him down, lift hips, armbar.

:submission: 
  :type: triangle
  :from: closed_guard:D
  :video: youtube:9brqQVrgqcc

  :opportunity:
    one arm over legs, one arm under

    If A puts one arm under your leg, you can get your knee up
    on his shoulder by his neck, then lock it with the other
    knee, and squish his head down in the triangle.

:submission:
  :type: kimura

  :opportunity:
    if A posts an arm, grab his wrist and lock it with your
    other arm passing over his shoulder and grabbing your
    own wrist.



Side Control
------------

:transition:
  :from: side_control:D
  :to: half_guard:D
  :opportunity:
    When A brings leg across for mount, weight will come off
    the trailing leg momentarily, so you can push it (his knee) over your
    leg to half guard.

:transition:
  :from: side_control:A
  :to: mount:A

  bring knee across his belly while staying tight and heavy
  on him.  then simply turn your knee and lower leg to his
  other side again without lifting your weight from him.
  Push his legs / knee down out of the way if you need to.


:submission:
  :type: guillotine
  :from: side_control:A
  :video: youtube:ySJXjAFRUO4

  :opportunity:
    If D turns to his side, switch your (left) arm from under his
    neck to behind his neck & around for the guillotine, while
    switching your base to lower leg straight out parallel to his
    body and upper leg perpendicular, knee flexed.

Mount
-----

:transition:
  :from: mount:D
  :to: half_guard:D
  :opportunity:
    If A doesn't have hooks in, presumably you can push his knee over your
    leg to half guard.

:submission:
  :type: americana
  :from: mount:A

:submission:
  :type: armbar
  :from: mount:A

  If D crosses his arms in front of his face, push his arm across his
  chest and pin his arm (from shoulder to elbow) with weight of your
  chest.

Half Guard
----------

:transition:
  :from: half_guard:D
  :to: closed_guard:D

  Hip-escape to get enough space to bring your near-side knee up
  to block his body from re-establishing mount or side-control.
  Then get leg around his back and hip-escape again to get space
  for getting other leg around to closed-guard.

:transition:
  :title: Throw opponent who stands up from your guard
  :from: guard_vs_standing:D
  :to: side_control:A

  Hold A's sleeve with both hands, left foot pushes his hip
  back while right foot hooks behind his knee to throw him down
  and to your right.

Standing
--------

:submission: standing_guillotine
  :type: guillotine
  :from: standing_face_off:D

  When he shoots for takedown, block him with both hands on his
  shoulders, then push his head to one side and wrap arm over & under
  his neck for guillotine.
